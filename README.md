### The results are pre-computed on this repository in two mods:
* Implicit Ranking _(unranked candidates on a ballot are evaluated on a new last rank)_ ** [Summary of the result](implicitRankingEvaluationOfVotes-summary.md)** (large table)
* Explicit Ranking _(unranked candidates on a ballot are ignored)_ ** [Summary of the result](explicitRankingEvaluationOfVotes-summary.md)**

_Unfortunatly, tab rendering in Github are now very readable actually_

### Detailed results and stats can be found in the [Results Output](Results_Output/) folder
